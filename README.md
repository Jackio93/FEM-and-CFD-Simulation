# Turbine Casing CFD & FEM Analysis

This project presents a **virtual validation of a turbine casing**, combining **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** and **Finite Element Method (FEM)** simulations.  
The goal is to demonstrate a complete engineering workflow â€” from 3D modeling to structural verification â€” for turbomachinery components.

## ðŸ’¨ CFD Analysis

The CFD analysis focused on the **velocity field and flow distribution** within the turbine casing.  
Main findings include:

- Maximum velocity of approximately **30 m/s** localized near the upper curvature region  
- Smooth flow distribution with minimal recirculation zones  
- Consistent behavior with the expected flow path for the given geometry

## ðŸ§± FEM Analysis

A **static structural analysis** was performed to evaluate the casingâ€™s integrity under representative loading conditions.  
The geometry was imported from the CFD model, meshed, and constrained according to realistic support points.

- Maximum **Von Mises stress:** ~6.9 MPa  
- The stress levels are **well below the yield strength** of typical casing materials  
- Uniform stress gradient indicating good stiffness and load distribution
